Many thought leaders often use the term "linking arms" to promote workplace cohesion. It paints a picture of team members coming together to solve a common purpose. Physical corporation for the purpose of workplace productivity. 

In the modern post-COVID era, this is a popular concept as it promotes collaboration in a time where everyone is in their own homes. However, this has simplified the concept to merely collaborating over a Google Meet, or editing a shared spreadsheet together. This simply does not capture the essence of team camaraderie that it is supposed to be.

While a nice thought, many have voiced that they feel more disconnected from their coworkers than ever before. Even with attempts at virtual arm linking activities such as virtual happy hours, or sprint planning meetings.

[A 2021 Globalization Partners survey][1] found that while many benefit from the flexibility that working from home offers, “many feel less connected to their colleagues than before”. With 32% now feeling less connected to their colleagues than before. We can only hypothesize that this may be related to a lack of proper arm linking events.

[According to Merriam-Webster][2], the definition of the term “linking arms” is:

> to hook bent arms together at the elbow

While we’d like to think that this is just an analogy to promote teamwork, I think there’s more to it than that. I believe that evidence shows that there is a primal human instinct that is awakened when teams literally link arms together.

As we can see in this prehistoric cave painting, the humans are linking arms for increased productivity. This shows that it is not merely an analogy, and is actually a practice dating back several thousands of years. In fact, our very ancestors may have linked arms for increased productivity, eventually leading to us being here today.

This also shows that is a natural human tendency to wish to link arms. While we may have evolved since the prehistoric era, we still have a deep desire to link arms. It just needs to be revived by a corporate team-building activity to do so.

Even Football players are [known to link arms][3]. This increases their proficiency in the field, even in the face of extreme adversity, and a strange political climate. This gives additional credence to the theory that linking arms is relevant no matter the subject matter. From cavemen, to football players, to software engineers, the practice can brings teams together.

We are still in the throes of a global pandemic, and it is understandable that some cannot gather in person. However, all teams should be considering organizing in-person arm linking events once it is feasible to do so. Ask your employees to actually link arms together. We may be surprised at the productivity results.
