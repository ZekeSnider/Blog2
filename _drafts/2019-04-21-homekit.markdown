# The hardware

The specifics will obviously differ based on what type of blinds you have. My blinds are twist blinds, which conveniently have a removable grip on the bottom of the rod, with has a hole on the bottom. I noticed this, and thought it would be perfect for screwing to a servo.

You'll need a screwdriver extension to properly screw into the servo through the grip. My extension was overkill on length, but got the job done.

I attached the grip back onto the blind rod, and we're almost good to go. Except I needed to attach it to the wall, and still have the flexibility to remove it in case I need to manually slide the blinds. I'm also renting so I didn't want to screw into the wall.
